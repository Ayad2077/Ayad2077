🧗 Ayad Abunab

**`Finance & MIS Student (Analyst / Developer / Creator)`**

I am a finance and management information systems student at the University of Washington Bothell. I like taking what I learn in class and turning it into simple tools, small models, and projects that solve real problems. I enjoy working with data, markets, and code, and I am building a portfolio that shows how I think, not just what classes I took.

Right now I am focused on growing skills for roles in investment banking, corporate finance, or related analyst roles, while also improving at coding, photography, and climbing.

### 📂 Projects and Experiments

<!-- Replace these with real repos when they are ready -->

- [finance-models-and-notes]([https://github.com/Ayad2077/2025-Spring-143-final-project.gi])  
  I built a small search engine in Java that lets users find exact phrases across documents quickly. It works by saving each word’s position in every document, so it can check phrases without scanning everything. I tested it to make sure results were accurate and faster than the basic version.

- [java-and-dsa-practice]([https://github.com/Ayad2077/Lab-10-.git])  
  This project combines two small Java programs that practice object-oriented design and array management. The first part, NationalCall, calculates the total price of a phone call based on duration and rate tiers, then displays call details like source, destination, and cost. The second part, LineAtOfficeHour, manages a waiting line of students using an array structure. It supports adding new students, removing the first student when they see the teacher, checking if the line is full or empty, and listing who’s still waiting.

 <summary><h3>My Journey</h3></summary>
 I started in business and finance, got curious about how systems and software work, and began learning code on the side. Now I am combining finance, MIS, and programming to build projects that are simple, clear, and useful. The plan is to keep stacking skills, work with sharp people, and use each project as a step toward bigger roles in finance and tech.
